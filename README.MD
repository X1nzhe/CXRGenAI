# Final Project Assignment – Applied Deep Learning and Generative AI in Healthcare
## Track 2: Text to Medical Image Synthesis (Image generation from Descriptions)
### Introduction: 
This project aims to develop a diffusion-based deep learning model 
for generating synthetic X-ray images from textual descriptions. 
By training the model, it enables the automatic generation of medical images from diagnostic inputs.
### Instructions to run the code

### Compatibility Notice
The project is independently runnable; 
however, it has been tested and trained on Google Colab, 
relying on Colab’s specific environment and hardware accelerations (e.g., GPU/TPU). 
Running it on other platforms may require additional setup, 
and proper functionality cannot be guaranteed.
